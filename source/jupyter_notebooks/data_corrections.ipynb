       "\"A car driver, who questioned a biker for ramming into his vehicle’s bumper, was thrashed by a gang of seven local men with rods and hollow blocks on Saturday evening in . The gang even vandalised his car and broke his right leg with a hollow brick. The victim was rushed to a nearby hospital and has been in the ICU for the past three days.   The victim has been identified as Murthy N, 28, a resident of KR Puram, who works at a private company as a driver. His brother, Somashekar, told  Mirror that on Saturday evening when Murthy was on his way to deliver a customer's car around 6 pm, a bike hit the car’s bumper from behind on Kodichikkanahalli Main Road in Bilekahalli. Murthy got down from the car and stopped the two-wheeler to ask the rider about it and an argument broke out between the two. The biker immediately called his friends and asked them to come to the spot. He said that while the two were arguing, around six to seven men joined the bike rider and started assaulting Murthy.  “They hit him with garage equipment, which they got from a nearby garage and broke the windshield of the customer’s car. My brother, who was terrified, started taking photos of himself bleeding and shared it on multiple social media groups requesting for help as there was no one around to help him. One of culprits, who was holding a spare handle of a bike, hit his face with it while another man picked up a rod and poked his left eye. After seeing him texting on the phone, the gang pinned him down and brought a hollow brick from a nearby construction site and threw it on his legs so that he couldn't escape,” Somashekar said.   Mico Layout police said that they were on rounds in the area at the time of incident and quickly rounded some of the accused up and rescued Murali. Police said that he was rushed to a nearby hospital. A senior officer said that they managed to catch the prime accused, Shivakumar, 28 and his friend, Harshith, 27, both locals and unemployed. “We have produced them before the court and have sent them to judicial custody. We are verifying the CCTV cameras from the surrounding areas to identify others and will soon arrest them,” he said.   Somashekar said that Murthy has sustained fractures on both the legs and the bone in his right leg was completely crushed by the brick. Murthy had to undergo a surgery to implant a rod in his right leg while his left eye is still swollen. Murthy is recovering and investigation is on.\""
